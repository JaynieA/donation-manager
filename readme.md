#Donation Manager

Donation Manager is a responsive, full-stack web application that tracks and manages the incoming donations received by the non-profit organization Spotâ€™s Last Stop Canine Rescue. It is a central location to which all data provided in the form of CSV reports from the various donation platforms on which donations are received (i.e. Razoo, Paypal, WePay) may be uploaded, stored, viewed, and organized.

Based on the donor information provided from the CSV uploads, the Donation Manager will allow the user to send a thank you email (personalized from a template), or generate a PDF letter (also personalized from a template) to be printed. It will provide a system for tracking both if and when each donor has been thanked for their donation to the organization. Users must be given administrator privileges in order to access and use this application.

* Ensure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed
* `npm install` dependencies
* `grunt uglify` to create minified client.min.css
